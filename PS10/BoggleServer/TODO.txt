-use if statement to clear text in chatbox only when necessary?
-allow 16 letter words? (would have to find new list)
-Only show all possible words upon request of client? (this would speed up the end of games)
-have how to play info?
-words sent right before end don't get added to summary lists. Any way to fix this?
-finish sounds in client
-dispose the SoundPlayers in client
-Get rid of Regex's...unecessary overhead?
-Find way to slide up chatDisplayBox when messages are at bottom
-Finalize server messages
-run a code analysis
-check for notes in code
-make sure server still handles multiple games correctly
-make sure all build options are good (for example, there's an optimize code option)

NOTES:
-IF I GET EXCEPTIONS IN MODEL, REMEMBER THAT I'VE COMMENTED OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMINATE

-Simply returning in catch statements in BoggleGame.cs, better to end thread somehow?

-I think the try is needed in Model.Terminate because sockets can closed twice
 (once as a direct result of a player clicking Disconnect, and then because of
 the received null string).

-WHEN DONE, CHECK IF ANY CODE NEEDS A LOCK
