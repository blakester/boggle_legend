-in BoggleGame.MessageReceived, some methods are being passed payload but could probably be passed player
-combine GameResumingHelper and GameCountdownHelper in mainwindow?
-Disable Play/Cancel button during countdown?
-have timestamp on chat messages?
-Ready, Set, Go instead of countdown?
-Get rid of Regex's...unecessary overhead?
-Find way to slide up chatDisplayBox when messages are at bottom
-Finalize server messages
-run a code analysis

NOTES:
-IF I GET EXCEPTIONS IN MODEL, REMEMBER THAT I'VE COMMENTED OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMINATE

-Simply returning in catch statements in BoggleGame.cs, better to end thread somehow?

-I think the try is needed in Model.Terminate because sockets can closed twice
 (once as a direct result of a player clicking Disconnect, and then because of
 the received null string).

-WHEN DONE, CHECK IF ANY CODE NEEDS A LOCK
