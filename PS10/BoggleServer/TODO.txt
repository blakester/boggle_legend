-Fix problem when game is paused with 1 sec remaining
-have countdown before game begins
-have timestamp on chat messages?
-require BOTH to resume to undo pause?

NOTES:
-IF I GET EXCEPTIONS IN MODEL, REMEMBER THAT I'VE COMMENTED OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMINATE

-I think the try is needed in Model.Terminate because sockets can closed twice
 (once as a direct result of a player clicking Disconnect, and then because of
 the received null string).

-WHEN DONE, CHECK IF ANY CODE NEEDS A LOCK
