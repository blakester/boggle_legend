-decide exactly how to use gameID
-have countdown before game begins
-change countdown to begin on gamelength and end on zero?

NOTES:
-IF I GET EXCEPTIONS IN MODEL, REMEMBER THAT I'VE COMMENTED OUT A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMINATE

-WHEN DONE, CHECK IF ANY CODE NEEDS A LOCK

-A game ended normally once but then immediately printed also that it ended prematurely.

-Is lock in BoggleGame.cs WordReceived() necessary?

-Is gameStart needed in BoggleGame.cs?

-I think the try is needed in Model.Terminate because sockets can closed twice
 (once as a direct result of a player clicking Disconnect, and then because of
 the received null string).
