-Is gameStarted needed in Model.cs? Does it work just being confined to MainWindow.xaml.cs?
  -Perhaps not related to gameStarted, but server sometimes only displays one disconnect 
   message when a player disconnects during a game. Some kinda race condition?
-Send message to client when server closes but before game starts
-create chat boxes
