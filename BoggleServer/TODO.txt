-check ReceivedMessage in Model.cs. BeginReceive is called by default when in fact communication with the server should
 be ended.
-create chat boxes

NOTES:
-in BoggleGame.cs Start(), after messing around with Connect/Disconnect on two clients from same IP,
 I got an object disposed exception on the timer.Change() method. I'm not sure why. I couldn't recreate
 the problem.

-Is lock in BoggleGame.cs WordReceived() necessary?
