-create chat boxes (if post game chatting is desired, SOCKETS HAVE TO REMAIN OPEN)
-have countdown before game begins
-change countdown to begin on gamelength and end on zero?

NOTES:
-A game ended normally once but then immediately printed also that it ended prematurely.

-in BoggleGame.cs Start(), after messing around with Connect/Disconnect on two clients from same IP,
 I got an object disposed exception on the timer.Change() method. I'm not sure why. I couldn't recreate
 the problem.

-Is lock in BoggleGame.cs WordReceived() necessary?

-Is gameStart needed in BoggleGame.cs?
