-Is gameStarted needed in Model.cs? Does it work just being confined to MainWindow.xaml.cs?
-Disconnections appear to be displaying properly, but look at Terminate in BoggleServer.cs; when the terminate message is sent,
 it is necessary that the callback doesn't close the socket because the client still needs to send back the IN_GAME_DISCONNECT
 and then the server closes the socket and prints the message. I should look into this setup, but I think it might be the best I
 can do. Maybe just have the call back (Deleteme) close the socket if there is an exception?
   
-Send message to client when server closes but before game starts
-create chat boxes
